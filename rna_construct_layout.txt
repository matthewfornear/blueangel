# === Synthetic Logic-Gated mRNA Construct ===
# Goal: Only express GFP if MYC is high, let-7 is low, and ROS is high
# Logic signature: (MYC_HIGH AND LET7_LOW AND ROS_HIGH) → GFP ON

# ------------------------
# [5' CAP]
# ------------------------
# The 5' cap is a chemical modification added to the beginning of all eukaryotic mRNAs.
# It’s required for ribosomes to recognize the mRNA and start building the protein.
# You don’t need to design this — it will be added automatically by the synthesis provider
# or in vitro transcription kit (e.g., with a capping enzyme or co-transcriptional cap analog).

# ------------------------
# [5' UTR region]
# ------------------------
# This region comes before the coding sequence (GFP).
# It controls whether translation happens, using a riboswitch.
# We will place a ROS-responsive riboswitch here.
# A riboswitch is a folded RNA structure that blocks the ribosome binding site (RBS)
# unless a specific molecule (in this case, reactive oxygen species) is present.

# ACTION: Search literature or RNA devices libraries for a validated ROS-activated riboswitch.
# Example term to search: "ROS-responsive riboswitch site:pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"

# ------------------------
# [Start codon: AUG]
# ------------------------
# AUG is the universal start signal for building proteins.
# It tells the ribosome: "Start building the protein here."

# ------------------------
# [Coding sequence: GFP]
# ------------------------
# GFP = Green Fluorescent Protein. Cells that express this will glow green under blue light.
# This allows you to easily test if the mRNA logic worked.
# Later, you can replace GFP with a therapeutic gene like Diphtheria Toxin A (DTA) or Granzyme B.

# ACTION: Copy standard GFP coding sequence from Addgene or NCBI Gene.
# Example search: "GFP coding sequence FASTA site:addgene.org"

# ------------------------
# [3' UTR region]
# ------------------------
# This region comes after the protein-coding part and controls mRNA stability.
# We will insert 4 binding sites for the microRNA let-7 here.
# If let-7 is high, it will bind these sites and destroy the mRNA.
# If let-7 is low, the mRNA survives and gets translated.

# ACTION: Insert 4x let-7a target sites (perfect seed matches) into the 3' UTR.
# Example target site: 5'-TACCTCA-3' (reverse complement of let-7a seed)

# ------------------------
# [Poly-A tail]
# ------------------------
# This is a long string of A’s (adenines) at the end of the mRNA (e.g., AAAAAA...).
# It protects the mRNA from degradation and helps with translation.
# This will be added automatically during synthesis or by using a polyadenylation signal in DNA.

# ------------------------
# [Promoter Region - for DNA delivery option]
# ------------------------
# If you are delivering this via plasmid DNA (not mRNA directly), you need a promoter upstream.
# This promoter determines whether the mRNA will be made in the first place.
# We want a promoter that only turns on when MYC protein is high.
# MYC binds to E-box motifs like CACGTG to activate transcription.

# ACTION: Add a synthetic promoter with 4x E-box repeats (CACGTG) + minimal TATA box.
# This ensures the mRNA is only transcribed in MYC-high cells.

# ------------------------
# END OF CONSTRUCT DESIGN
# ------------------------
# This file describes a full logic-gated mRNA system:
# ROS-activated riboswitch (5' UTR) AND
# MYC-responsive promoter (DNA level, optional) AND
# let-7 repression (3' UTR)
# → control expression of GFP in cancer-like conditions

# Next Steps:
# 1. Gather actual sequences for each part (riboswitch, miRNA sites, GFP).
# 2. Simulate folding with RNAfold or NUPACK.
# 3. Build plasmid or mRNA using Benchling or order synthesis.
