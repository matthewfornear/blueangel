# MYC response module
# Function: this promoter causes transcription of the mRNA only in MYC-high cells
# Method: uses 4 tandem E-box motifs (CACGTG) which are bound by c-Myc
# These are placed upstream of a minimal promoter (e.g., TATA box)
# Source: synthetic promoters in use for MYC-responsive expression (literature + plasmid databases)

# Example synthetic MYC-responsive promoter sequence:
CACGTGCACGTGCACGTGCACGTGTATAAAAG

# Notes:
# - CACGTG = E-box motif (bound by c-Myc)
# - 4x repeats = increases sensitivity to MYC
# - TATAAAAG = minimal promoter core to allow transcription start
# - Place this upstream of the entire RNA construct if delivering via plasmid or DNA
